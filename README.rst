- Origin: Acquired by Håkon Wiik Ånes and Jarle Hjelen at NTNU in 2021.
- Description: Three experimental EBSD patterns of (480 x 480) pixels from a
  single crystal Silicon sample acquired with a stationary beam but with
  camera distances varying by 5 mm.

- Origin: Acquired by Jarle Hjelen in 2023.
- Description: A (60 x 60) set of experimental EBSD patterns of (48 x 48)
  pixels from a super duplex stainless steel (austenite and ferrite).
  The low resolution is the result of downsampling by a factor of 2.
